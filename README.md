Hello, this is my first game uploaded on itch, as well as my first game jam game for githubs game off. 
To play the game, go into the downloaded file, then dist, then it will be there.  
This game is inspired by the greek mythology the Minaotur, but less dark.  The main goal is to escape the maze before the Minatour, (red) catches you. 
The game has a fog of war effect, which means you can only see a tiny radius around you. I also did the small palette challenge, as this game has only four colors.
